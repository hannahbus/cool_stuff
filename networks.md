Here is a more or less random compilation of network-related papers, I came across. Selection criteria are (i) cool research question (ii) cool data, and (ii) cool methods. The list is under study revision.  

## Measuring networks 

"Collecting survey-based social network information in work organizations" (2021) available [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873321000290?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email)

"Social distance in France: Evolution of homogeneity within personal networks from 2001 to 2017" (2021) available [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873321000435?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email) 

Compares social network snapshots to understand changes in social ties; detect a higher tendency towards homogeneity, which is not fully explained by demographic shifts. Results are consistent with findings from Hungary and the US. Tendency towards greater homogeneity has relevant societal implications.
