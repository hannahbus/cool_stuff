# Papers 

Here is a more or less random compilation of network-related papers, I came across. Selection criteria are (i) cool research question (ii) cool data, and (ii) cool methods. The list is under steady revision.  

## Measuring networks 

"Collecting survey-based social network information in work organizations" (2021) available [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873321000290?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email) 

In essence, a guide on how to get network data from firms using survey methods. 

"Social distance in France: Evolution of homogeneity within personal networks from 2001 to 2017" (2021) available [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873321000435?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email) 

Compares social network snapshots to understand changes in social ties; detect a higher tendency towards homogeneity, which is not fully explained by demographic shifts. Results are consistent with findings from Hungary and the US. Tendency towards greater homogeneity has relevant societal implications. 

"Identifying relationships between personal social networks and spatial mobility: A study using smartphone tracing and related surveys" (2021) available [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873321000708?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email)

Study social networks and spatial mobility.

Studies homophily in legislative networks. 

## Organization

Team players improve team performance, experimental evidence.

## Network Interaction

Seek to understand social interactions dynamic within the network - reciprocity (e.g. return a favour) - and triadic effects (form the missing link to build a triade).
